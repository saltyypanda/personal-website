        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Esther (Tess) Hacker, a software engineering major from RIT. I did not code before college, but when I did I fell in love. I had found something both that I liked and that my brain was built for. It quickly became both a passion and part of my identity. I’m lucky to see problem solving not only as a job, but as something fun and enjoyable.
        </p>

        <p>
            As mentioned, I attend RIT for a bachelors of science in software engineering. I am a first year student planning to graduate in 2027. I currently have a 3.7 GPA and have been on the Dean’s List for RIT’s Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences both semesters of my first year. During my time here, I have attended both major hackathons, BrickHacks and WiCHacks, and I volunteered with members of the Computing Organization for Multicultural Students in organizing and running the Tiger Games Game Jam hackathon. My project for WiCHacks won the Simone Center award for most commercially viable product (see Projects section, Show to Tell).
        </p>

        <p>
            I am an active member of RIT’s Society of Software Engineers as well as RIT’s Computing Organization for Multicultural Students. I have also worked as a Course Assistant for RIT’s Software Development and Problem Solving courses, a coding mentor for the Society of Software Engineers, and a coding tutor.
        </p>

        <p>
            In terms of technical skills, I am familiar with Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. See Skills section for more.
